# dotfiles

### > wsl + alacritty + tmux + nvim

`main` branch has the stable working dotfiles

I am still figuring out the best way to organize everything and how I want the workflow to be, branches may be created/deleted unexpectedly

### todo:
* [ ] find a better diffview/commit merge solution (or see what can be improved with vim-fugitive or lazygit)
* [ ] config aerospace
